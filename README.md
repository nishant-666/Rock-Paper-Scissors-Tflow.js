This repository contains a demo written with TensorFlow.js that lets users play Rock Paper Scissors with their browser. It is based heavily on the code for Google's [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).

To run it locally, you must install Yarn and run the following command to get all the dependencies.

```bash
yarn prep
```

Then, you can run

```bash
yarn start
```

You can then browse to `localhost:9966` to view the application.

This demo was written for the book [Deep Learning in the Browser](https://github.com/backstopmedia/deep-learning-browser). You can check out the book's main repository [here](https://github.com/backstopmedia/deep-learning-browser).
